Used with Slack webhooks. You can find the configured slack integrations at http://your-slack-domain.slack.com/services

## Usage

If you need to change which words the reminder triggers to or the link to the trello board, you will need to do that from the Azure portal.

If you need to change which channel the bot users and any other slack related config, you would need to do that in the webhook setup - http://your-slack-domain.slack.com/services
